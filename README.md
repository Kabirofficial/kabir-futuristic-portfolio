This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, designed with a futuristic aesthetic and interactive elements to highlight my skills and projects as a web developer.

**Key Features:**

*   **Futuristic Design:** Cyberpunk-inspired visuals, including neon colors, glassmorphism, and animated backgrounds.
*   **Interactive Elements:**  Engaging user experience with dynamic content, Three.js 3D elements, and smooth transitions.

*   **Clean and Modular Code:**  Well-organized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easy maintenance and customization.
*   **Focus on Performance:**  Optimized assets and code for fast loading times and a smooth browsing experience.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** Semantic markup for structure and accessibility.
*   **CSS3 (with SCSS):**  Styling and layout with custom properties, animations, and responsive design.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):**  Interactive features, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous operations.
*   **Three.js:**  3D graphics and interactive elements.
*   **DOMPurify:**  HTML sanitization for security.

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kabirofficial/kabir-futuristic-portfolio.git
    cd kabir-futuristic-portfolio
    ```

2.  (Optional) If you plan to use SCSS, you'll need to compile the `style.scss` file into `style.css`. You can use a tool like Sass or Dart Sass.

## Customization

*   **Content:** Update the `index.html`, `about.html`, `skills.html`, `achievements.html`, `projects.html`, and `contact.html` files with your personal information, skills, projects, and contact details.
*   **Styling:**  Modify the `css/style.css` file to customize the colors, fonts, layout, and animations.
*   **3D Elements:**  Adjust the Three.js code in `js/script.js` to modify the 3D elements and interactions.
*   **Contact Form:** Configure the Formspree integration in `contact.html` with your Formspree endpoint.
*   **Images and Videos:** Replace the placeholder images and videos in the `images/` and `videos/` directories with your own assets.
